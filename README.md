## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8
- Django 3.2
- Django Rest Framework 3.12
- Docker
- Docker Compose
Make sure you have the above requirements installed before proceeding. Try running the following command to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After, you can proceed to check if they are installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
python --version
docker --version
docker-compose --version
djangorestframework --version
```

### Setting up Docker environment
_________________________________

This section provides step-by-step instructions on
how to set up and work with the literal project using Docker and Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to install Docker. 
Follow these steps based on your operating system:

### For Windows and macOS:

1. *Download Docker Desktop*: Go to the [Docker Desktop website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

2. *Install Docker Desktop*: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

### For Linux:

1. *Download Docker Engine*: Go to the [Docker Engine website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and follow the instructions for your Linux distribution.
2. *Download Docker Compose*: Go to the [Docker Compose website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and follow the instructions for your Linux distribution.
3. *Add your user to the docker group*: Run the following command in your terminal:
   bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   
   You will need to log out and log back in for this to take effect.
4. *Verify that Docker is installed correctly*: Run the following command in your terminal:
   bash
   docker run hello-world
   
    This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.
5. *Verify that Docker Compose is installed correctly*: Run the following command in your terminal:
   bash
   docker-compose --version
   
   This command prints the version number of Docker Compose.

## Docker Compose Workflow Guide

### Starting Docker Compose

- *Navigate to the literal project root folder*:

Replace DB variables in .env in order to use docker db

DB_HOST='db'
DB_NAME='postgres'
DB_USER='postgres'
DB_PASSWORD='postgres'
DB_PORT=5432

- *Start Docker Compose*:
  bash
  docker-compose up
  
  Add -d to run containers in the background.

## Checking Container Status

- *List Active Containers*:
  bash
  docker ps
  
  This will show container IDs, names, and status.

## Entering the Shell of a Container

- *Find the Container ID or Name* (use docker ps to list running containers):
  bash
  docker ps
  

- *Access the Container's Shell*:
  Replace container_id_or_name with your container's ID or name.
  bash
  docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/bash
  

## Entering ZSH Terminal (Optional)

- *Once in the Container's Shell*:
  bash
  exec zsh
  

## Exiting the Container's Shell

- To exit the shell without stopping the container:
  bash
  exit


### Setting up Django environment

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to install Python and Django.
Follow these steps based on your operating system:

1. *Install Python*: Go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python.

   bash
   pip install django
   
   You can also install a specific version of Django by running:
   bash
   pip install django==3.2

#### Django Workflow Guide

- *Run Migrations*:
  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate

    ```

#### Accessing the API

After running the server, you can access the API by visiting the following URL in your browser:

```bash
http://127:0.0.1:8000
```

### Running Tests
